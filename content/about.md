The Ortonville Farmers Market is a project of the [Ortonville Downtown Develeopment Authority](http://www.ortonvilledda.org/) (DDA). The first market planning committees started working in March of 2018, and the first live market was held on May 4, 2019!

We hope that this market will bring local produce and farmed foods, crafts and other surprises into the lives of our visitors. Visiting and shopping at the market benefits you and your family, our local producers, and helps to build a strong downtown community and culture.

Together, let's build a community that we are proud to be a part of.

The market runs every Saturday May-October in Downtown Ortonville.
