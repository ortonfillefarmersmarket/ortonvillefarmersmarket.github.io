Interested in becoming a vendor at the market? Great, we are interested in having you join!

* The first step is to read and fill out the vendor application [here](http://vendorDocsADD).  
This application can be printed and mailed to the Ortonville DDA office at 476 Mill Street, Ortonville, MI 48462, or they can be emailed as an attachment to aaron@blahblah.com

* The next step is to read and sign the [market rules](http://vendorDocsADD).  
These rules govern your conduct at the market. We advise that you print these rules out and keep them with you at the market.

* Third, all vendors are required to have liability insurance by law. We need proof of insurance on file before you are able to sell at the market. The farmers market also carries liability insurance, but this does not cover individual vendors.

* Lastly, we require copies on file of any licensing that your business may hold, such as organic certification or verification that you fall under the Cottage Foods Law. We cannot allow vendors to make specific claims or serve specific products without licensing, under state law. These rules vary according to the products being sold.
